# 🚀 Final Stage Instructions

## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initial Setup
You will find new files in each of your drives:
- `modeling.ipynb`
- `train.py`
- `dataloader.ipynb`

### 2. Run the Data Loader
- Open and execute all cells in `dataloader.ipynb`.
- This will export edge lists to your data folder in the corresponding file.

### 3. Modeling Phase
- Proceed to `modeling.ipynb`.
- I recommend running the default model to understand the training process.
- You can review `train.py` to see how the model is trained using **DGL**.

### 4. Check Your Tasks on GitHub
- Head to the GitHub repository where specific tasks are assigned to each person.
- Each of you will be implementing a unique function:
  - 🧠 **Half of you:** Model additions
  - 🧬 **Other half:** Model layer additions

### 5. Editing Guidelines
- Each file contains default model and layer classes—**⚠️ Do not modify those!**
- Your specific task is at the bottom of the file.
- Tasks are designed to be short—**~2-3 lines of code**.
- Don't overthink it! I know finals are stressful.

### 6. Objective
- The goal is to understand the intricacies of the graph neural network model, **not** to build it from scratch.
- As you work through each component, you will learn how they interact with each other.

### 7. Final Steps
- Once your addition is complete:
  - **Rename your class** to its original name (e.g., `HeteroRGCNLayer` or `HeteroRGCN`).
  - Replace `model.py` in the `gnn` folder with your updated file.
  - Run the model and observe how it impacts your metrics.

## ❗ Important Note:
This part might be challenging, and it’s okay if you can’t finish on time.  
If needed, **Subhash and I** will take over.  
The main goal is to get you **familiar with deep learning**, so focus on learning rather than perfecting!
