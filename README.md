Task Descriptions for Model and Layer Class Enhancements

Model Enhancements

Person 1: Add Dropout Regularization (Samyak)

Task: Implement a dropout layer to the base model to reduce overfitting. The dropout should be applied after the hidden layers but before the output layer.
Importance: Dropout regularization helps in preventing the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons by randomly disabling them during training. This ensures better generalization on unseen data.

Person 2: Implement Batch Normalization (Allie)

Task: Add batch normalization to the base model, specifically between the hidden layers. Make sure to adjust the forward method accordingly.
Importance: Batch normalization stabilizes training by normalizing input layers, allowing for faster training times and potentially improved performance.

Person 3: Introduce Early Stopping (Aaron)

Task: Implement early stopping within the model training loop to halt training when performance on the validation set stops improving.
Importance: Early stopping can save computational resources and prevent overfitting by stopping training when the model starts to over-optimize on the training data.

Layer Class Enhancements

Person 4: Add Attention Mechanism (Nimrah)

Task: Enhance the layer class by integrating an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes during message passing.
Importance: Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on the most relevant nodes in a graph, which is particularly useful in heterogeneous graphs with varying node types and edge relations.

Person 5: Implement Residual Connections (Dhriti)

Task: Modify the layer class to introduce residual connections between the input and output of each layer.
Importance: Residual connections help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and improve gradient flow, enabling the construction of deeper models without performance degradation.

Person 6: Include Edge Feature Aggregation (Sachin)

Task: Adjust the layer class to incorporate edge features into the message-passing process. This might involve concatenating or multiplying edge features with node features.
Importance: Leveraging edge features can provide the model with additional context, improving its ability to learn relationships within the graph's structure.

These tasks are designed to introduce valuable features into the base model and layer class, offering avenues for improved performance, stability, and interpretability of the graph neural network.
